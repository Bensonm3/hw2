Getting Started:
Open either the contact, portfolio, or index.html pages 
Once open, the other pages can be navigated to using the appropriate link at the top of the page

Project Features:
Fluid containers that adjust to the size of your browser screen
Use of pseudo classes to change an object based on its status (active, hover, etc)
Inclusion of Google fonts to add some unique character to the pages


	
Known bugs:

The contact box does not shrink to the appropriate size on screen size 640px. my 80% width 
	code works in the console, but for some reason not in the html
At certain sizes the pages will start to do funky things, but for the set widths they 
	should look similar to the requested formats
